## Quick Start

First you need to have nodejs on your machine, you can install it from https://nodejs.org/en/ then clone the repository and open the terminal in the project's directory and execute the following commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start
```
In this project you can:
1- register & login
2- create, edit and delete posts
3- only the author of the post can edit and delete it
4- you can comment on the post

This is just a frontend project (not connect to an API, the data is saved locally).
You can find a tinyMCE editor when you add/edit a post.
